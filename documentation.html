        <p>I learned through a lot of trial and error how to animate what and how I want using the library of anime.js. I also utilized particles.js in my project and
            I had to learn how the functions worked together and what variables meant to implement it in my site the way I wanted to. I used a lot of timeout functions in my
            site to keep the theme intact of the transition from each page and tried many values to make the overall experience seem coherent and pleasing enough to view. Most of
            what I wanted to do and listed in my initial proposal was able to be completed, although I couldn't get the bouncing of the balls for page 1 to work. I thought initially
            before starting that it wouldn't be too difficult to move the elements I wanted to the way I desired, but the hardest part about making the transitions flow was to experiment
            with timings and javascript timeout functions so the elements appear / disappear the way I want them to. Anime.js and particles.js were both fun to learn and felt great to
            utilize in my javascript applications within the site. With the way I designed the site, I also tried to maintain background color from the index to each page.</p>
