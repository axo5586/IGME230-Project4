# IGME230-Project4

Andy Ong's Project 4 repository for IGME230

  I plan to make a navigation page using moving / animated shapes that move across the screen to then make text appear. 
This text will notify the user to click on 3 different links that link to 3 different demos of javascript usage that will have roughly the same idea; use animated shapes that move either across the screen upon opening the page that reveals text or interactive buttons to affect the animation or interact with it in some way. 
The demos I had in mind were:

1.	Squares moving from across the screen, top to bottom, like the navigation page, but they turn into circles along the way and do not completely leave the screen and stay at the bottom. Those same circles could then be dragged with the cursor upon clicking and moving it that would float as if in a low gravity environment. 

2.	Squares moving from across the screen, right to left, as if it’s a curtain and reveals a demo of colorful particles moving randomly across the screen like stars. If a user’s cursor is on the webpage, the particles that move are attracted to a circle formed around the cursor.

3.	A bunch of small squares move from across the screen, left to right and right to left with a random distance offset for each frame until they get to the end of the screen and they repeat like ping pong balls going horizontally endlessly. The user can press various buttons like restart, to restart the animations, and play and pause buttons.

	I will need to learn how to code particles and physics for this project and also control those particles to move in a certain location, such as a circle around the mouse cursor. The resource that I’m using to make this project will be Ani.me, a javascript library that allows the coder to animate HTML objects.		


A rough coded demo of the navigation page has been provided in the github folder called "Demo".
