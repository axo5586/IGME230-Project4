# IGME230-Project4

Andy Ong's Project 4 repository for IGME230

  I made a website utilizing 3 different applications of javascript utilizing the 2 javascript libraries of anime.js and particles.js. Each page, before opening, has a transition created using timeout functions, and shapes going across the screen to reveal the applications of javascript. The animations for all 3 pages utilize moving shapes of some sort. My profile picture uses SVG graphics and all the squares in the website were made by filling colors into a div; so they are resizable friendly. Here are the three pages I created:

1.	Squares moving from across the screen, top to bottom, like the navigation page, but they turn into circles along the way and do not completely leave the screen and stay at the bottom. 

2.	Squares moving from across the screen, right to left, as if it’s a curtain and reveals a demo of colorful particles moving randomly across the screen like stars. If a user’s cursor is on the webpage, the particles that move are repelled to a circle formed around the cursor.

3.	A bunch of small squares move from across the screen, left to right and right to left with a uniform ffset for each frame until they get to the end of the screen and they repeat like ping pong balls going horizontally endlessly. The user can press various buttons like restart, to restart the animations, and play and pause buttons.



// FROM MY INITIAL PROPOSAL //--

	I will need to learn how to code particles and physics for this project and also control those particles to move in a certain location, such as a circle around the mouse cursor. The resource that I’m using to make this project will be Ani.me, a javascript library that allows the coder to animate HTML objects.		

A rough coded demo of the navigation page has been provided in the github folder called "Demo".
